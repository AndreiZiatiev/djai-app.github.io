Lots of big news today.  We've moved from Tech Preview into Beta!  This is a
great milestone and we continue to improve the project and make good strides
in (hopefully) the right direction.

The first beta release has some nice new features (have a look at the 
[details here](https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-studio/releases/tag/v0.1.0)).
But perhaps even more exciting is that we've rebranded everything as the
new project name:  "Apicurio Studio"

Therefore, I'm please to announce that the permanent home for the project 
is now here:

* [Project Site](http://www.apicur.io/)
* [Github Org](https://github.com/Apicurio)

As always, happy Designing!
